			I am a full-stack software engineer focusing on JavaScript & TypeScript, Node, React, Nextjs
			and the gorgeous Svelte.
		</p>

			Although I am focusing on JavaScript, I am training myself as a language agnostic-dev. I love
			Functional Programming concepts.

			I am also interested in Cloud solutions such as AWS/GCP/AZURE, actively learning AWS and I am
			working towards AWS certification.
